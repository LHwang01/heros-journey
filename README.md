<p>Welcome! This is probably my favorite project thus far! This is a video game titled The Hero's Journey, built using Unity. This game is a platformer where you
take the role of a squire who takes a test to become a knight. Collect as many gold stashes as you can while avoiding other knights to become knighted, or maybe even 
get a higher title! This game has story, music and sound effects, and multiple endings depending on how well you score. Try to get them all!</p>
